matrix {
  0 a12 a13
  a21 a22 0
  0 a32 a33
}

vector {
  b1
  b2
  b3
}

\section{Original system}
\label{original}
Assuming the unknown variable vector is represented as $\variablevec$,
what we do is solve the following problem:
\[
\originalmat
 *
\variablevec
=
\originalvec
. \]
Equivalently, we can consider the following linear system:\\
\originaltab

\section{Triangularized system}
\label{triangle}
Now, using Gaussian Elimination we obtain the following matrix equation:
\[
\trianglemat
*
\variablevec
=
\trianglevec
\]
Equivalently, the linear system:\\
\triangletab

\section{Solution}
Now, the solution for the system described in Section~\ref{original} and
triangularized in Section~\ref{triangle} is:
\[ \solutionmat \]
It can also be written as equalities:\\
\solutiontab

\section{Conclusion}
I don't know who did this but it's pretty fucking awesome.
