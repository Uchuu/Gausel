Gausel
======

Solves a linear system symbolically and produces a LaTeX file containing all the information linked to the resolution as new commands.

Content: the archive you downloaded should contain:
 - the present README file,
 - gausel_2.9.2-1.0-onejar.jar,
 - an example folder with two example files, "testwithtext" and "testwithouttext".

Gausel takes files in a special syntax as input, take a look at the examples in examples/.
You can put LaTeX in the input file, as in examples/testwithtext.
It will be put in the body of the resulting LaTeX file.
You can also only specify the linear system (as in examples/testtextfree), the body of the LaTeX file will be empty.
The syntax itself is pretty much self explanatory.

Try it on an example with
java -jar gausel_2.9.2-1.0-onejar.jar examples/testwithtext
