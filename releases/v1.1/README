Gausel
======

Developper: Dame Ningen [dame.ningen@mail.com]

Gausel solves a linear system symbolically and produces a LaTeX file containing all the information linked to the resolution as new commands.

Content: the archive you downloaded should contain:
 - the present README file,
 - the COPYING file,
 - gausel.jar,
 - an example folder with two example files, "testwithtext" and "testwithouttext".

Gausel takes files in a special syntax as input, take a look at the examples in examples/.
You can write LaTeX in the input file, as in examples/testwithtext.
It will be put in the body of the resulting LaTeX file.
You can also only specify the linear system (as in examples/testtextfree), the body of the LaTeX file will be empty.
The syntax itself is pretty much self explanatory.

You can launch gausel by running
  java -jar gausel.jar
which will display help as to how to use Gausel.

Try it on an example with
  java -jar gausel.jar examples/testwithtext
The tex file will be generated in a folder called "gausel" where the input file is.
Here, examples/gausel/testwithtext.tex.
You can generate the corresponding pdf file by running
  pdflatex examples/gausel/testwithtext.tex
on linux.
You can also specify a different output folder:
  java -jar gausel.jar examples/testwithtext different/output/folder/
  pdflatex different/output/folder/testwithtext.tex
